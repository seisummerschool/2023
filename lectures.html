                    Ana Cavalcanti (University of York) is Professor of Software Verification and Royal Academy of Engineering Chair
                    in Emerging Technologies working on Software Engineering for Robotics: modelling, validation, simulation, and testing.
                    She currently leads the RoboStar research group at the University of York. She held a Royal Society-Wolfson Research
                    Merit Award and a Royal Society Industry Fellowship to work with QinetiQ in avionics. She has chaired the Programme
                    Committee of various well-established international conferences, is on the editorial board of four international
                    journals, and is Chair of the board of the Formal Methods Europe Association. Her current research is on theory
                    and practice of verification and testing for robotics.

                <h5>RoboStar framework for design and verification of robotic systems</h5>
                <p>
                    Simulation is favored by roboticists to evaluate controller design and software. Often, state machines are
                    drawn to convey overall ideas and used as a basis to program tool-specific simulations. The simulation code,
                    written in general or proprietary programming languages, is, however, the only full account of the robotic system.
                    In this course, we present the RoboStar technology, a modern approach to design that supports automatic
                    generation of simulation code guaranteed to be correct with respect to a design model, and complements simulation
                    with model checking, theorem proving, and automatic test generation for simulation. Diagrammatic domain-specific,
                    but tool-independent, notations for design and simulation use state machines, differential equations, and
                    controlled English to specify behavior.
                    This course will be co-lectured by

                    Jim Woodcock FREng is the Professor of Software Engineering at the University of York. He holds two additional
                    posts: he is a Professor of Digital Twins at Aarhus University in Denmark and a 1,000-talents Professor of
                    Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) at Southwest University in Chongqing. He is an award-winning researcher with
                    40 years' experience in formal methods for software engineering. He has widely cited theoretical work in
                    efficient verification algorithms for security and in more general software and hardware semantics. His work
                    has been widely used in practice. He is a long-term consultant to the UK government on system security
                    verification, including co-authoring a secure office automation system for the UK government. He created
                    the theory and practical verification for NatWest Bank's Mondex smart-card system, the first commercial
                    product to achieve ITSEC Level E6 (Common Criteria EAL 7). He has made significant contributions to the
                    Verified Software Initiative. He was a principal investigator in the EU FP7 COMPASS project on model-based
                    systems of systems and in the EU H2020 INTO-CPS project on integrated toolchains for CPS. He currently leads
                    the research team in York for the Verifiability Research Node in the EPSRC Trusted Autonomous Systems
                    Programme. For the last decade, he has researched the theory and practice of CPS and, more recently,
                    verified robotics and digital twins. He leads the research team that is developing theories for modelling
                    and verifying CPS and robotics using the Isabelle/UTP theorem prover. Jim is a fellow of the UK Royal
                    Academy of Engineering and a Chartered Engineer. He has served as head of the Department of Computer
                    Science in York.

                    Dr. Xin Chen is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of
                    Dayton. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University in 2015, and was a
                    postdoctoral research associate at the University of Colorado Boulder. Dr. Chen is primarily
                    interested in developing both model-based and model-free techniques for safety verification and
                    resilient control of autonomous systems. He is the primary developer of the CPS formal verification
                    tool Flow*. His research work is funded by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory.

                <h5>Functional Overapproximation for Reachability Analysis of Neural Network Control Systems</h5>
                <p>Formal verification of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has been a significant research topic due to the
                    increasing use of computer controlled systems in safety-critical areas, such as power systems,
                    medical devices and autonomous vehicles. However, such tasks are often very difficult because of
                    the complicated behavior of CPS. Reachability analysis is an effective way to formally prove the
                    safety of a CPS over a bounded or unbounded time horizon. A reachability analysis approach computes
                    an overapproximation of the reachable set and verifies whether there is any unsafe state included.
                    If not, then the system is safe. The main challenge of computing a valid reachable set
                    overapproximation is to control the growth of overapproximation error which is also called
                    overestimation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This course focuses on the reachability analysis of an important class of learning-enabled CPS
                    which are called Neural Network Controlled Systems (NNCS). We present a polynomial arithmetic-based
                    framework named POLAR for computing higher-order overapproximate reachable sets for NNCS. We
                    progressively teach the techniques by describing (1) the existing set-based computation methods
                    and functional overapproximation forms such as Taylor models, (2) the Taylor model-based
                    verification techniques for nonlinear hybrid systems, (3) functional overapproximation for
                    feedforward neural networks and its use in computing accurate reachable sets for NNCS. Besides,
                    a short course of using Flow* and POLAR will also be provided.
